## Level
* Beginner

## Skills
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Open Closed Principle (OCP)

## Instructions
* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and 
  for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## Additional Instructions
* When you’ve got it all working for “Fizz” and “Buzz”, add “Whizz” for 
  multiples of seven
* Then add “Fizz” also for all numbers containing a 3 (eg 23, 53)

## Retrospective
* Is the code you have written clean? Are there any smells?
* Did you refactor throughout or do it all at the end?
* What if a new requirement came along that multiples of seven were “Whizz”? 
  Could you add that without editing the existing code? 
  (Cue discussion of the Open Closed Principle)
